<p id ="crime">Crime occurs all everywhere- even on college campuses. Ensuring your safety on your campus is possible by taking these steps and knowing what resources are available to you.</p>

<div id= "whatToDo">
<ul>
      <li><p><strong>Always stay alert. </strong> Keep your head up and know your surroundings so you won't be caught by surprise.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Stay in areas with a lot of people.</strong> A crime is less likely to occur if there are many witnesses. Use well-lit paths on- and off-campus. Avoid dark streets, where criminals can more easily hide.</p></li>
      <center><img src="https://www.eatingdisordertherapyla.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/o-COLLEGE-STUDENTS-ON-CAMPUS-facebook.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;"></center>
      <li><p><strong>Know the resources available to you.</strong> Know how to contact campus police or city officers. Check if your campus provides special services to keep students safe late at night.They're there to protect you and help you get home safe, so don't be afraid to call them. Many campuses have emergency phones or emergency lights to ensure students' safety on campus. When you are walking in an unfamiliar part of campus, watch for these lights along your route so you know the location of the nearest one in case you need it. Call <strong>1-800-656-4673 </strong>for the National Sexual Assault Hotline</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Use the buddy system. </strong>Walk in pairs or in a group. The more eyes, the better. Stick together: We're sure you've heard of the buddy system, so make sure you actually stick to it the entire night! Try to let at least one person know where you are going and when you are expected to return. Make a plan with your friends beforehand and don't leave anyone behind at a party, especially if they're at a stage where they can't make the best decisions for themselves.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Carry devices for protection. </strong>Pepper spray is the worldwide leader in items you can use to ensure your safety. Most sprays have a 10-foot range so you can protect yourself while at a safe distance from an attacker. Carry a whistle or other type of alarm so you can quickly - and loudly - grab someone's attention in case of an emergency. Using items such as keys, pencils, pens, or books can also be used to defend yourself against an attacker.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Protect your drink.</strong> Don't leave your drink unattended, and watch out for your friends' drinks if you can. If you go to the bathroom or step outside, take the drink with you or toss it out. Drink from unopened containers or drinks you watched being made and poured.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Know your limit. </strong>Off-campus parties may provide plenty of alcohol, but you'll let your guard down if you're drunk. Keep track of how many drinks you've had, and be aware of your friends' behavior. If one of you feels extremely tired or more drunk than you should, you may have been drugged. Leave the party or situation and find help immediately.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Follow your instincts. </strong>If you question the safety of a campus area, leave. If you notice something that doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Be aware of your surroundings at all times and take extra steps at night to stay safe on campus. Chances are that you'll be fine, but if you are the victim of a crime, be sure to call the police right away.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Make sure your phone is charged. </strong>We know cell phone batteries can drain quickly, so make a point of plugging it in before you head out. The last thing you want to happen is realizing your phone is dead when you need to make an emergency phone call.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Don't stop moving.</strong> Unfortunately, an attack can take place anywhere, even on your beautiful college campus, especially when you're alone and entering your building. Spend as little time as possible lingering outside your residence. As you approach your building, start to take out your keys so you can head right in.You can also call a friend or family member to keep on the phone as you walk home. But be careful; don't get too wrapped up in a conversation that you don't realize someone might be following you.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Be secure. </strong>Make a habit of securing windows and doors. Just because you're in your building, doesn't mean there won't be anyone threatening present. Prevent someone from entering by locking it whenever you leave and whenever you go inside. Any windows that are adjacent to a fire escape should be locked, especially when you leave or go to sleep.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Be cautious, not paranoid. </strong>When you're in a relaxed, yet cautious state, you are more capable of distinguishing a dangerous situation from something that might just be in your head. Take steps to increase your awareness and alertness in your surroundings, which can include things like taking one earbud out if you're listening to music, or looking ahead of you instead of down at your phone.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Don't be afraid to speak up.</strong> Whether you're at a party and someone is getting too close for comfort, or if you're on the street and you see a man attempting to rob someone, don't hesitate to say something. Verbal commands can be incredibly effective. As a bystander, you have a greater ability to think on your feet and alert others if something is wrong, which could come in handy if you ever find yourself in a tricky situation.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Download safety apps on your phone.</strong> Lots of apps have been developed to help college students call for help in times of trouble. For example, apps like SafeTrek, KiteString, and Circle of 6 communicate to your friends when you're in trouble, and also tracks your location so that your friends (and the police) can find you.</p></li>
